## 2026-09-01 — Phase 1: official ADK recipe study

Isolated change: completed the mandatory pre-scaffold study and recorded Qali-specific reuse and deviation decisions in [reference-recipe-study.md](reference-recipe-study.md).

Reason: the approved implementation plan requires code-level study of matching official recipes before Agents CLI scaffolding or application code.

Skills and guidance:

- `google-agents-cli-workflow` 1.4.2
- `google-agents-cli-adk-code` 1.4.2
- `tdd`
- `google-agents-cli-adk-code/references/samples.md`

Official source:

- Repository: `google/adk-samples`
- Revision: `cf7cadbc537cab9a6105a9b9adf5a2af2da43061`
- Recipes: `long-horizon-harness`, `ambient-expense-agent`, `safety-plugins`, and `cross-session-memory`

Commands and evidence:

- Cloned the official repository into a temporary sparse checkout at the pinned revision.
- Read every selected recipe's `AGENTS.md` and the exact implementation files listed in the study record.
- Compared each pattern with the approved [.agents-cli-spec.md](../.agents-cli-spec.md) and [QALI_V2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](../QALI_V2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
- Produced the reuse/adapt/reject matrix and first tracer-bullet consequences in [reference-recipe-study.md](reference-recipe-study.md).

Deviations:

- Replaced Pub/Sub-specific ambient ingress with signed Slack ingress plus Cloud Tasks.
- Replaced paid LLM-judge and Model Armor safety dependencies with deterministic mandatory controls for the private free-tier phase.
- Replaced Agent Engine Sessions and Memory Bank with Firestore and GCS durability.
- Narrowed the long-horizon environment and delegation patterns to a typed specialist workflow and deny-by-default Playwright MCP facade.
- Strengthened secret resolution to fail closed and required restart/cross-thread durability tests absent from the reference recipes.

Phase result: passed. No application scaffold, cloud resource, deployment, or external integration was changed during this phase. `agents-cli` and `uv` remain prerequisites for Phase 2.
